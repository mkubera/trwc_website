          <p>
            <strong>Klaus Totzler:</strong> Does what you do have anything to do
            with pop at all?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Peter Christopherson:</strong> I find it difficult to
            categorise my music into a genre. In the past, especially in the
            sixties, pop music surfed on a certain wave. Back then, pop music
            was the language of the generation that embodied rebellion and
            change. But since then, pop has been increasingly corrupted and thus
            destroyed. What people like me are doing today is more in the realm
            of art than in the music scene. Emotional, passionate and, if you
            like, even spiritual. But our art has never made an impression on
            the art scene. Nor is it aimed at the art gallery market. Our art is
            simply placed in the public sphere, in the room, and anyone who
            feels addressed should pick it there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>KT:</strong> Did you always want to provoke in order to make
            a difference?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> It was never about provocation, it was always
            about content that has meaning for us. Some of it is serious, deep
            and dark. But to equate dark with evil is wrong anyway. People who
            like our music like it because we deal in truth. Things that are
            true for us are important for us and probably for our audience too.
            Just making love songs - what kind of meaning does that have?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>KT:</strong> You&#39;ve been critical of the new media from
            time to time recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> You have to take a differentiated view. But in
            principle, I think the internet is good, especially for starting
            something. The most important thing is to establish contact with
            people first. Of course, the internet has now become such an
            important part of our lives. If you&#39;re a bit consistent,
            you&#39;ll become better known anyway, with or without the internet.
            I also have the great advantage of having been around for so long.
            Then there are also fans all over the world who are curious about
            what we do, who search the Internet for sites that deal with our
            work, with Coil or TG. Analogue or digital, it&#39;s always easier
            for us to communicate than if we had to start from scratch. If you
            have good ideas, a vision and passion, then you can still be
            successful today without allying yourself with the music industry.
            The music industry is an anachronism, a dinosaur that should have
            been buried many years ago. About 20 years ago there were only a
            handful of artists involved in experimental art, today there are a
            few hundred working on it? If you keep control of your creative
            work, you can still create something that is good and different.
            Will it reach anyone? You don&#39;t make music for the market
            anyway, you make music for yourself. But on the other hand, I
            usually make music that I like to listen to and that depends on what
            I&#39;m listening to at the time. If I listen to all of
            Autechre&#39;s albums, then my next album will certainly sound a bit
            like them. In that sense, I&#39;m also influenced by the market. But
            in my opinion, you can&#39;t create music by trying to copy
            something or with the intention of serving the market. If you want
            to find your niche, you have to listen to your heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>KT:</strong> Douglas P alias Death in June was once excluded
            from a festival because he obviously uses fascist symbols but
            refuses to distance himself from the ideology. What&#39;s your
            opinion on this?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> I don&#39;t want to go into detail about Death
            in June right now. I&#39;m neither a fan of their music nor of the
            people behind it. But it&#39;s OK the way they operate. They have
            been with the same distributor as us. I&#39;m not Douglas&#39;
            lawyer and I don&#39;t want to speak on his behalf. On the other
            hand, media people in particular always confuse the use of symbols
            and their meaning. If I may give you an example: music critics argue
            that it would be fine to refer to the attack on the World Trade
            Center in the news. But that wouldn&#39;t work in a song. But that
            doesn&#39;t make sense. If things have social or historical
            significance, there has to be access to them for everyone. Whether
            they are symbols or ideologies. And it must be allowed to comment on
            it artistically. That has nothing to do with approval or
            disapproval. Anyone who knows my work knows that I am an extremely
            political person. And we (Coil) have strict views on what behaviour
            is appropriate. They are positive and absolutely life-affirming.
            Doing good is important. And we have always rejected hate.
            Especially those that are directed against certain groups. It
            doesn&#39;t matter whether they are homosexuals, Americans or
            Germans. We also treat nature, the planet and animals with love and
            respect. But there are groups who think it&#39;s a good idea or
            particularly clever to identify with fascist imagery. And they
            totally overlook the damage they are doing by encouraging people
            with truly fascist ideas to act inhumanely. So, to be clear, if a
            band uses Nazi imagery and doesn&#39;t make it clear what stance
            they&#39;re actually supporting, they can expect a lot of people to
            react very dismissively and angrily. We want people to always take
            responsibility for how they act. If other people misinterpret these
            artistic representations and use them as encouragement for their own
            hateful criminal behaviour, then the artist must come out and make
            that clear. He must say that he distances himself from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>KT:</strong>Does that also apply to shrill glam rockers like
            Marilyn Manson or Rammstein?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> Rammstein and Marilyn Manson are, to a certain
            extent, cartoon characters. I hardly think that an intelligent
            listener or viewer takes them literally and completely seriously.
            But I&#39;m afraid many people, especially in America, are not smart
            enough to tell the difference. They can&#39;t tell the difference
            between the real devil and a comic figure. I find that kind of
            disappointing, but that&#39;s the problem with Americans. Marilyn in
            particular is certainly relatable and extremely intelligent.
            He&#39;s clever enough to manipulate the media and abuse it for his
            commercial interests. I actually have a lot of respect for him, but
            would personally choose a different path. But he knows exactly what
            he&#39;s doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>KT:</strong> Church and religion. What role do these terms
            play for you?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> I have a special relationship with the church.
            It&#39;s also good that it works for me (laughs). That was silly, I
            know. But I can&#39;t talk about what I believe in because it&#39;s
            always difficult. I just know that nothing happens by chance and the
            end is not the end. I have no idea why I believe that. It&#39;s kind
            of ‘ritualistic’. Almost everyone believes that all these things
            that are difficult to understand are out there somewhere. The church
            is up there on the hill. And so you have to do what they tell you.
            But that&#39;s not true. It&#39;s all inside you. You just have to
            listen to yourself. Then suddenly everything becomes obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>KT:</strong> So where does your faith come from? What is the
            basis?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> There is probably no chance of making the world
            a better place. However, you have to fight for it and act
            accordingly, but - well, that&#39;s a philosophical topic. On the
            one hand, I am extremely pessimistic about the fate of the human
            race, but you must never give up trying to improve it. Because
            that&#39;s the obligation you have as a human being. As a teenager,
            we/had many heroes who influenced me: William Burroughs, Brion
            Gysin, John Giorno. And they greatly improved my life when I was 11,
            12 or 13. Because I had read her work, I knew that the bad things I
            had been through were not inevitable. This knowledge has changed my
            life. And as a creative person, I feel that it is my duty to pass
            this awareness on to others. And the more people who think this way,
            the better our quality of life can be. Does that sound pretentious?
            I believe that it&#39;s my job to show people that it&#39;s possible
            to live differently from the masses and still act morally right and
            lead a great life.
          </p>
          <p><strong>KT:</strong> Just recently there was a reunion of TG.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> I have nothing to say about that. The fact is
            that it somehow became necessary for the four of us to live on
            different continents. I live in Asia, Genesis P-Orridge in the
            United States and Chris and Cosey in England. Perhaps our tolerance
            has decreased over the last 30 years. More tolerant of humanity, but
            perhaps more intolerant of our own faults and weaknesses. On the
            other hand, I believe that today more than ever the world needs the
            ideas and feelings represented by Throbbing Gristle. Even more than
            when we started. The music business has collapsed so much in the
            last 30 years. And people are so overloaded by the flood of
            information that it seems impossible to react to it in an
            appropriate way without ulterior motives. Our hope is that we&#39;ll
            shake people up enough to make them question: Hey, why am I
            listening to this all day long, and why am I doing this job and not
            another one? And why am I living in a way that doesn&#39;t make me
            happy? If this question can be asked, it will certainly lead to a
            number of other questions. (Genesis P-Orridge on this: ‘It&#39;s
            about destroying consumerism for the good of consumerism and making
            people aware of this content.’) We can&#39;t give a right answer.
            The important thing is that people ask themselves the right
            questions individually. I hope that the concerts will also be
            provocative. A concert like this should not necessarily be a
            comfortable experience. But we hope it is a useful one. Sometimes a
            gig like this is also uncomfortable for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>KT:</strong> Genesis has probably drawn the most radical
            conclusions from his vision as an artist. After periods of life as a
            cult leader, attacks for pedophilia and other borderline
            experiences, he now lives as a man/woman/hermaphrodite with golden
            teeth. How far does art have to be consistent?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PC:</strong> With TG, Genesis was always the person who
            stood at the front. The person at the front is always particularly
            exposed. He often puts himself out there, makes his wealth of ideas
            available to the public. He has always done this more than the other
            three of us. John Balance always had a similar role with Coil. And
            this role is totally demanding. It&#39;s not like you just go up
            there and sing. People like that reveal their innermost selves. Over
            and over again. Something like that can cost you your sanity, it can
            kill you. I mean, it&#39;s not the same approach to art as Jim
            Morrison or Kurt Cobain. But they went through something similar.
            Often people like that have very personal problems on top of that,
            and that makes it even harder for them to fulfil this ‘job’. It
            would be easier to get through it if you worked in a factory or at a
            petrol station, because then you wouldn&#39;t be so exposed to the
            public. That&#39;s probably why there are only a few artists or
            groups who do what we do. Because it&#39;s just too stressful. Boyd
            Rice sometimes does something similar, maybe a few others from this
            genre. But otherwise? Well, I personally believe that Nina Simone
            made herself more vulnerable and revealed more of her innermost self
            than Nick Cave.
